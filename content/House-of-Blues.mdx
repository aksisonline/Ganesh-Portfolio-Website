My Role:

*   Technical Producer.
    

My contribution:

â€‹Team Leadership:

*   Led and managed a team of modelers and texture artists, fostering a collaborative and productive environment.
    

Agile Project Management:

*   Developed and oversaw sprint plans using Trello, ensuring timely progress and delivery of project milestones.
    

GitHub Repository Management:

*   Established and maintained the Unreal Engine 5 GitHub repository, enabling seamless collaboration and version control.
    

Milestone Evaluations and Feedback:

*   Conducted milestone evaluations, providing constructive feedback and actionable suggestions for continuous improvement.
    

Workflow Optimization:

*   Implemented efficient sublevel creation in the scene, enabling multiple team members to work simultaneously on importing assets.
    

Challenges:

*   While importing the assets from maya to unreal engine, as multiple modelers are assigned with different assets to model and import to unreal engine, everyone mostly uses it at the same time, when a person creates merge request after they import the asset and when it gets approved the other modelers assets would be lost in the scene, i came up with a solution to have persistent level and separate sub level for each modelers and it prevented from overlapping of work and loosing it.
    
*   In the 1st version of the project we didnt notice that project was not scaled according to reference and when the project is in the final stage we relaised it was outscaled and to overcome this we have created a new scene with realtime scanned meshes to use it as reference and the problem was solved as we reimport the outscaled objects in the scene from maya to unreal engine.
