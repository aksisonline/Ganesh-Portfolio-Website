# Tail wind
Instantly throw a projectile that expands into a brief vision-blocking cloud on impact with a surface. HOLD the ability key to curve the smoke in the direction of your crosshair.

## Blue print logic
- Step 1: Create a Key Binding for Dash 

- Step 2: Assign input action in Thirdperson Blueprint character

- Step 3: Assign input dash to ground friction and set the value ( in this particular scenario I have chosen 1.5 which is right fit and ground friction target should be the character movement because we care increasing the friction for character only.

- Step 4: Assign the ground friction node to launch character

So when the player press "E" (assigned dash input key) the character friction is increased to 1.5 so the character slides on surface and then we need to add a delay function and add one more ground friction node and set it to 0.8 which is default friction. we have added delay node and connected to ground friction  because when we launch the dash ability the friction is increased to 1.5 and after a delay of 2 sec it comes back to normal friction

I have added Dash Function and connected it to last launch direction to prevent it from changing the direction when dash function is used.

# Updraft
Instantly propel Jett high into the air.

# Cloud Burst
It's a Vision Blocker ability that Jett instantly throws forward on activation

## Blue print logic
- Step 1 : Create a actor blueprint and a select a sphere

- Step 2 : Create a blueprint logic on component hit and connect it to set direction to make smoke flow in the direction at which it is used.

- Step 3 : Connect it to the velocity (set the velocity to zero) and set the target to projectile movement and connect it to projectile gravity scale (set the value to zero so that smoke will not get effected by gravity in the direction of travelling)

- Step 4 : connect it to world scale 3D and set the scale (i have set it to 3 for all axis) , connect smokes to the target. (with this when smokes hit anything environment, the smokes get expanded to the scale of 3)

- Step 5 : connect scale 3D node to delay node (value set to 4 sec) and connect it to destroy actor. ( with this when the components hit anything in environment the size of the smoke increases to 3 and it stays for 4 sec in that particular place and then the actor gets destroyed).
