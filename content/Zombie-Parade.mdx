# Wave Increment and Zombie Spawn

When all the zombies in the level are eliminated, the next wave should start with double the number of zombies in the previous level

In this blueprint logic the current wave is set to one at start of the game and for each wave increment the current wave is multiplied by 2 and it is set to the total number of zombies to that particular wave, so if the level is 3 its multiplied by 2 and 6 zombies will spawn in wave 3

When zombies left in level is zero, so the condition is true then its accesses the wave increment custom node and it increments the current wave.

For the zombie movement added AI ( behavioral Tree), added logic to move zombie to random locations (normal movement) in a certain amount of radius. when player is in vision of zombie then the zombie starting moving ( Run movement) towards the player and if in certain range zombie attacks the player.

# Zombie Attack Logic

# Area Unlocking System

In level there are 3 unlockable areas, To unlock them the player needs to collect certain amount of money by killing zombies.

When the player overlaps with the object UI will pop up and shows the required amount of money and on end overlap event it checks whether the player has required amount of money and if its true the obstacle will be destroyed and UI pops up , player can access that location.

When player has the money to unlock area the obstacle will be destroyed with explosion effect and will collisions will be removed and player will be able to access the location

On wave increment the total number of zombies is divided in between two spawn points equally and Array has been used to randomize the zombies that needs to be spawned.
